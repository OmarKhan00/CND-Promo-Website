            "ChargeNextDoor exists to address the growing demand for accessible and convenient electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, particularly in residential areas where public charging stations may be limited. The platform connects homeowners who have EV chargers installed with EV owners who need a place to charge, allowing homeowners to monetize their chargers and offering EV users an easy way to find available charging spots near them. By fostering a community-driven solution, ChargeNextDoor helps support the transition to clean energy, promotes the use of electric vehicles, and creates a more sustainable, decentralized charging network.",

          title: "How is CND different from  other charge sharing apps from other charge sharing apps   ",
          answer:
          `
                  <p>ChargeNextdoor stands out from other EV charging apps in a few key areas:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>1. Homeowner-Centric Model:</strong> CND focuses on allowing homeowners with Level 2 chargers to become hosts, offering a unique model where people with private charging stations can monetize their equipment. This creates a decentralized, community-driven charging network rather than relying on large public charging stations or commercial providers.</li>
              <li><strong>2. Flexible, Localized Access:</strong> CND’s model caters to apartment, townhouse, and semi-terrace residents who may not have easy access to traditional charging infrastructure. The app helps connect EV owners with available chargers in local neighborhoods, often making charging more convenient for those who may not have a charger at home.</li>
              <li><strong>3. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Charging:</strong> Unlike many commercial charging stations, which are managed by large networks, CND uses a peer-to-peer system. This means that users are directly connecting with other EV owners and homeowners, facilitating more personalized, flexible charging options in residential areas.</li>
              <li><strong>4. Revenue for Hosts:</strong> CND offers a unique opportunity for homeowners to generate income by renting out their chargers, turning an underused asset into a passive income stream. This can be especially beneficial for those who might have excess capacity or chargers not being used at all times.</li>
              <li><strong>5. Focused on Sustainability:</strong> CND prioritizes sustainability and the transition to electric vehicles by supporting the growth of decentralized, home-based charging infrastructure, which complements broader goals of reducing carbon emissions and promoting clean energy.</li>
            </ol>
            These differentiators make ChargeNextDoor not just another charge-sharing app, but a platform that empowers homeowners, improves convenience for EV owners, and supports the eco-friendly movement by building a localized, community-focused charging ecosystem

          title: " Is there a membership cost or contract to use the app?  ",
          answer:
          "There are no contracts to sign or membership to pay for before using the app. We only take 10% of the charge session each time you use it. This comes out of the Host charging price.   ",
        },
        {
          title: " Do you have to own an Electric Vehicle to be a Host? ",
          answer:
          "No , although it is expected that most hosts are EV owners. We expect Hosts to be renting out chargers that’s have been provided as part of their property and some which have fitted them specifically to make income from spare space on their property. "

        {
          title: " What about risks and liabilities? ",
          answer: `
          <p>It is each user’s responsibility to conduct appropriate risk assessment and implement proper safety measures.</p>

          <p><strong>For Hosts:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure the charger is safe, functional, and compliant with all relevant standards.</li>
            <li>Keep the charging area free of hazards.</li>
            <li>Maintain the same safety and care as you would for personal use.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>For Users:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the charger responsibly.</li>
            <li>Avoid causing damage - treat it like any borrowed property.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Insurance & Coverage:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Theft or damage during a session is generally covered by your car insurance.</li>
            <li>A Host’s home insurance may cover property damage, but this is not guaranteed.</li>
            <li>Please consult your insurance provider to confirm what’s covered.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Final Note:</strong> Many Hosts accept a small inherent risk, similar to lending a bicycle. While Users are responsible for any incidents, specific insurance is rarely carried for such informal use. We encourage everyone to make an informed decision based on their comfort with this level of shared responsibility.</p>

If your home electricity rate is 30¢ per kWh and you use a standard 7.4kW charger, you can price your charging service based on kWh. For example, if a user consumes 40kWh per week, and you set your price at $0.50 per kWh, the total revenue per session would be $20 (if the User charges weekly). ChargeNextDoor takes a 10% fee, amounting to $2 per session. The electricity cost for 40kWh at $0.30 per kWh would be $12, leaving you with a profit of $6 per session. Over the course of a year, with one session per week, this could add up to approximately $312 in earnings from just one regular user.  "

          title: " How do I decide what price to set for renting out my charger? ",

          `
          <p>As a host, you set a price ($AUD/kWh) for the charger; you're renting out your charger and not selling your electricity.</p>
          <p>When setting the price, you need to take into account the following:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>What electricity will cost you:</strong> During the host setup process, the app provides guidance on the wholesale electricity price provided by your distributor in your location.</li>
         <li><strong>Wear and tear on your charger:</strong> Consider the maintenance and depreciation of your charger over time.</li>
         <li><strong>A decent amount to reward yourself:</strong> Ensure you’re fairly compensated for providing the service.</li>
         <li><strong>The 10% fee:</strong> The app will take a 10% fee to keep running ChargeNextDoor (CND).</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> The price is subject to change at any time. However, any price adjustments are reviewed by us to ensure fairness and prevent monopolistic practices or price gouging, particularly in areas with low host penetration.</p>

If the user cancels within 2 hour of the booking time, the pre-authorization amount will be refunded. If not, the pre-authorization is transferred to the host, and the driver will be charged a penalty fee which is 10% of the estimted charge amount.

          answer:
          `
            <p>When a user books a session with a host, an estimated cost is calculated based on the current charge level of the user’s EV and the additional charge they wish to add. At the time of booking, a percentage of this estimated cost is pre-authorized on the user’s payment method using Stripe’s Payment Intents API with an authorization hold. This ensures the user has sufficient funds without immediately processing the charge.</p>

            <p>Once the user starts charging at the reserved time and ends the session, the actual cost of the session is determined based on the kWh consumed and the host's set rate. The pre-authorized amount is adjusted accordingly:</p>

            <ul>
            <li><strong>If the final cost is equal to or higher</strong> than the pre-authorized amount, Stripe captures the full amount or the final adjusted amount.</li>
            <li><strong>If the final cost is lower,</strong> the difference is released, and the user is only charged the actual amount.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In cases where the session is canceled or not completed, the pre-authorization hold will automatically expire after a certain period (typically 7 days, depending on the bank and Stripe settings).</p>
